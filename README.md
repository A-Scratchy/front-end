If you're no stranger to React applications and the JavaScript ecosystem:

```sh
# Clone the repo

# Install dependencies
yarn

# Run local development
yarn dev
```

and if you're working on something involving the back-end, you can run it locally:

```sh
# Have Docker running
yarn backend

# In a separate terminal
yarn dev
```
